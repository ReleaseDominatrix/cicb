5.1.1: 

NetBSD is stupid.  It doesn't default to having /usr/pkg/lib in its
ld.so.conf, so it needs LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you compile dynamically,
and if you try to compile statically, libc and libresolv fight and
its poor little linker can't figure it out.  removing -lresolv 
works, but to make ./configure figure this out takes a lot of
senseless rearranging.  Perhaps trying to actually link something
statically, or some kinda "if NetBSD-Sucks" test... 

logging should continue to happen when we pause for [=more=] if asyncread
is true (reported by synk)

personalhilite is case-insensitive now, but probably still should get
tweaked to make sure that nicks are matched only against whole tokens from
personalhilite.  (At present, it's a case-insensitive substring match.)

Timestamps should be built into the replay log instead of logged as text
to the replay log.  It would just make more sense that way.

implement a no-frills mode in cases where we have to fall back completely
due to lack of readline and/or tcl. 

support bizzare native OpenBSD and NetBSD readlines

internal icb functions (like s_who) need to behave like tcl procs so you 
can do things with them in the tcl interpreter...  or at least provide 
copies that do the right thing...

Trig_invitemsg needs some reworking of statusmsg() in msgs.c so that we
can extract the group name as well as the username from the invite string.
I think we can also pull out the dependancy on the VMS server here. :)

5.2: 

is there a way we can support a split-screen mode and the user being in
multiple groups?  (this may require a coordinated server hack).  I dunno.
It's something to think about.. I see lots of users starting up multiple
clients with different nicks so they can be in multiple groups..  It
strikes me as a very IRCish behavior, though.  I dunno.
